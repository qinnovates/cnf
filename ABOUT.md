# About the Author

I'm an independent security researcher with an incurable curiosity for how complex systems break—and how to design them so they don't.

## The Origin

My obsession with "how things work" started in middle school, the moment we got our first Packard Bell computer. By 11, I had built my first website—teaching myself through the vast, unlimited knowledge of the early internet. I created a community of 3,000+ members where I shared Photoshop tutorials, inspired by strangers who freely shared their knowledge with a curious kid asking too many questions.

That experience shaped me. The ONI Framework is how I pay it forward—a framework I hope can inspire others in this emerging field.

## The Foundation

My work ethic comes from watching my father, an autodidactic electrical engineer from China, navigate a world that didn't recognize his brilliance. Despite deep technical knowledge, he had no formal education and immigrated here to work as a dishwasher—all to help pay for his father's woodworking factory, which eventually burned to the ground.

That fire nearly cost our family the ancestral home: a single roof in a small fishing village that sheltered three generations at once. Watching him engineer a life for us out of nothing, balancing manual labor with the precision of a self-taught mind, taught me what grit truly is.

To me, engineering isn't just a career. It's a survival mechanism—turning uncertainty into something measurable and actionable.

## The Work

Over 15+ years, I've worked across biotech, high-scale consumer tech, publishing, and institutional finance. I've specialized in stepping into "void environments"—places where data exists at astronomical scale, but the systems to interpret and secure it don't.

Whether protecting digital identities of millions in consumer tech or securing high-value assets during complex financial acquisitions, the challenge was always the same: thinking simultaneously like an engineer, an adversary, and a human operator.

## Why ONI

Everything I build is about **protection**.

The ONI Framework is the culmination of that mindset—a living research effort to develop rigorous, testable frameworks that protect the "crown jewels" of what makes us human: our unique cognitive fingerprints, as we enter the age of brain–computer interfaces.

Our minds deserve the same security architecture we've built for our networks. This is that architecture.
