# Session Log: 2026-02-06


## Pre-Compaction Flush [06:57] (trigger: auto)

**Context preserved before compaction:**
- Config parses clean. Here's the final tally:
- Good — we're at Entry 30. Let me add Entry 31 (device taxonomy + frequency registry) and Entry 32 (7-layer architecture finalization) in parallel.
- Entry 31 already exists from the other session (NSP pitch). I'll add as Entry 32 and 33.
