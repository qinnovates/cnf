## Pre-Compaction Flush [07:51] (trigger: auto)

**Context preserved before compaction:**
- Good catch. The threat model data in the viz is missing the `classical` and `quantum` detection fields from config.py. Let me check what's showing for S2 and fix it.
- Now let me replace the entire threat_model array with the full data from config.py including `classical` and `quantum` fields for every entry.
- Now update the detail view to show the `classical` and `quantum` fields for each attack.
- Now reload and click on S2 to verify the full threat data shows.
