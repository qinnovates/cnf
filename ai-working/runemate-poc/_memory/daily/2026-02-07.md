## Pre-Compaction Flush [16:12] (trigger: auto)

**Context preserved before compaction:**
- The PoC works. The results are honest and telling:
- Now run the full benchmark with all three sample pages:
- The benchmarks are clear. Now let me rename everything from "Runeword" to **Runemate** and update the requirements doc with the actual benchmark data.
- Now let me add the actual benchmark results to the requirements doc.

## Pre-Compaction Flush [17:36] (trigger: auto)

**Context preserved before compaction:**
- The hardware research agent is done and the pitch research agent has all its data (it tried to write a file but got blocked on permissions — I have its content). Let me now write the pitch additions d
- Both done. Here's what was created:
- Both research agents are back and their findings are already incorporated into the two documents I wrote. All tasks from the original brain dump are now complete:
- All research agents are done and their findings are already in the pitch doc. Everything from the original brain dump is complete.
- The Proxmark Easy is fine for the demo use case described in the pitch. Here's the comparison:

**Context preserved before compaction:**
- Now add the key research sources that the agent found. Let me add the Synchron Series D and In-Q-Tel sources.
- Now add the additional sources from the research agent.
- Article is complete and enriched with all the research data. Here's a summary of everything created:
- Let me read the NSP protocol spec and the existing pitch docs to understand the RFC framing, then update the article.
